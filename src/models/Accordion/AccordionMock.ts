      "The casing screws onto the shower apparatus, and then the actual tablet is placed into the casing. All you have to do is put the two together and turn the shower on. It dilutes the ingredients into the water while you're having your shower and it lasts up to an average of 8 minutes or more, depending on the water pressure. Please know that the tablet, nor the goodness may not dissolve in cold water. The tablets are for one use only, so please empty the contents of the casing after showering and rinse out the contents of the casing to prevent any bacteria from growing. Rinsing out the contents also prepares you for your next great Spa Ur Self Botanical Shower experience.",
